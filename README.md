### Data download, loading, and wrangling

The `data` folder contains all GSS data files from my initial extraction from [NORC/GSS](https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data). 

This folder also contains the GSS Codebook for variable names, GSS Release Notes from 

the initial extraction, and the `.sav` data file.

I included the R script for my data wrangling and creation of the data set I use called `GSSsmall.csv`. Replicators can create their own version of this data set, but I have also included it for ease.

### Replication Code

The replication code R script located in the main folder under `Replication Code.R`.
